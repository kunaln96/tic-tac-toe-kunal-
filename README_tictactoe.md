This repository is for playing tic-tac-toe on the command line. 
It is a two player game with configurable board size. Asks the players to place "X" and "O" on the board. 
The game ends when someone wins or it is a tie. 

The code has been divided into three scripts:
1) board.h --> Header file for the board.cpp where all the functions have been stated 
2) board.cpp --> C++ file with all the functions for the insertion of Xs and Os on the board, winning conditions for the players as well as displaying of tic-tac-toe board 
3) main.cpp --> main file for running the code and declaring the output of game 


We will be using the g++ compiler for creating an executable file. 
Command used : sudo g++ board.cpp main.cpp (This is for creating the executable)  (-c flag for just compiling) 

Running the code : 
After using the above command, an executable a.out file will be created in the directory.
Run that file by using the ./a.out command in the current terminal.   

ENJOY YOUR TIC-TAC-TOE GAME WITH YOUR FRIENDS!!!!
